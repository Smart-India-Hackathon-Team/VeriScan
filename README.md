# VeriScan - Social Media User Authenticity Checker

VeriScan is a Python-based mobile application developed during the SIH Hackathon 2023. It leverages machine learning, specifically the scikit-learn library with a Random Forest model, to determine whether a social media user is real or fake. This app is built using the Kivy framework for the user interface and provides a simple and effective way to verify the authenticity of social media profiles.
